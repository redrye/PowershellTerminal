# Terminal++ Library

Library support for the `terminal++` advanced features. 

Should be of immediate use to any client applications, anyone interested in hosting a `terminal++` session should instead look at the `tpp-widget` and its implementation. 

> As `terminal++` clients are planned almost exclusively for the Linux system, the Windows versions of various classes in the library are not implemented at the moment. There are no immediate plans to change this.

The following sections briefly explain the classes of the library and the extra `terminal++` features.

# TODO

- Should Data be called Transfer?
- Should TransferStatus contain also last packet id?
