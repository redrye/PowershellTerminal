# `t++` Benchmarks

This repository contains the various benchmarks and the benchmarking scripts used to measure the performance of `t++` compared to other well known terminal emulators on the supported platforms. 

## Benchmarking Terminal Emulators

Benchmarking terminal emulators properly is actually quite a challenge so all data reported here should be taken with a big grain of salt.

# TODO

- create simple scripts that run the vtbench differnt stuffs + my own benchmarks on the various terminals and report them in a javascript or shiny R app. 
- should work for both Windows and Linux
- should be used for regression tests, etc. 
- maybe use release in order to distribute the large files
