        The renderer provides interface to schedule functions to be executed in trhe main UI thread. These functions can be tied to a particular widget belonging to the renderer, in which case the scheduled function will only execute igf the widget has not been detached in the meantime. If scheduled function is not tied to a widget, it will always execute as long as the renderer which created it still exists. 

        Internally each renderer has a dummy widget that is used to tie all its unregistered events, and which gets deleted when the renderer is deleted so that the events can be tracked. A widget remembers its number of currently scheduled events and if this is non-zero and the widget is detached, the event queue is examined and the events are descheduled. 

        The renderer and its event queue are decoupled so that multiple renderer instances running in same thread can share same event queue. The event queue also abstracts of the implementation details of scheduling and executing the events and allows event processing separate from the renderer itself.
